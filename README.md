# Quadratic residues

## Euler's Criterion and Legendre symbol

<p>
  Refer to [https://crypto.stanford.edu/pbc/notes/numbertheory/qr.html], I couldn't explain them better.
  The only thing which is not clear here is why we have $- 1$ as a quadratic residue if and only if

  $p \equiv 1 \mod 4$

  #### Fast ex.

  $4^2 \equiv -1 \mod 17$

  hence in this case we would have $- 1$ as a residue, indeed

  $(- 1)^{(p - 1)/2} = (- 1)^8 \equiv 1 \mod 17$

  It's quite intuitive at this point to say that if $(p - 1)/2$ is even then we can have $- 1$ as a residue, otherwise we can't. For ex. imagine $(- 1)^3 \equiv - 1 \mod 7$. Indeed $3$ is odd. 

  Now, following [https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/122048/1-is-a-quadratic-residue-modulo-p-if-and-only-if-p-equiv-1-pmod4] we can see that if we have a residue which is $- 1$, then it must be that

  $a^2 \equiv - 1 \mod p$

  And since $(- 1)^2 = 1$, then it must be that

  $a^4 \equiv 1 \mod p$

  which means that we chosed $a \in Z_{q}^{*}$ where $Z_{q}^{\ast}$ is a subgroup of $Z_{p}^{\ast}$ of order $4$. By Lagrange's Theorem it must be that $4|p - 1$, and therefore

  $p \equiv 1 \mod 4$

 ### Extension to $Z_{\phi(p^k)}^{\ast}$

 <p>
   We want to prove that the former section's result holds for powers of odd primes.
   
   $\phi(p^2) = p(p - 1)$

   If

   $a^2 \equiv - 1 \mod p^2$

   then

   $a^4 \equiv 1 \mod p^2$

   therefore by Lagrange $4 | p(p - 1)$, and since $p$ is not divisible by $4$ it must be that $4 | p - 1$, thus

   $p \equiv 1 \mod 4$

   This result can easily be extended to any $p^k$ since

   $\phi(p^3) = p(p(p - 1))$<br>
   $\phi(p^4) = p(p(p(p - 1)))$

   and so on.

 ### Extension to $Z_{\phi(n)}^{\ast}$

 <p>

   $x^2 \equiv - 1 \mod 2^k$

   is impossible because

   $2 \equiv 2 \mod 4$

   and for $2^k, k > 1$
   
   $2^k \equiv 0 \mod 4$
  
   Now we can finally generalize and say that if

   $n = 2^{k}p_{i}^{k_{i}}$

   for odd distinct primes $p_{i}$, by the CRT, $- 1$ is a quadratic residue iff $k \leq 1$ and each $p_{i} \equiv 1 \mod 4$. The condition $k \leq 1$ is because

   $\phi(2p_{i}^k) = \phi(2)\phi(p_{i}^k) = 1(p(p \dots (p - 1) \dots )) = \phi(p_{i}^k)$

   therefore $2$ is irrelevant and can coexist, while if it was at least $2^2$ we would have

   $x^2 \equiv - 1 \mod 2^2$

   using the CRT; and since it doesn't have solutions we can state that $n$ can't have $- 1$ as quadratic residue (works for any $k$).

   To conclude we can see a similar behaviour between the existence of generators, and the existence of $- 1$ as quadratic residue $(\mod n)$, i.e. if we consider $Z_{\phi(n)}^{\ast}, n = 2^k*\dots, k > 1$ we can't have generators nor $- 1$ as quadratic residue.
